A woman claims that the director pleasured himself by sucking on her toes during a one-night stand.
Forget boobs or butts, Quentin Tarantino is clearly a foot man, if the latest rumor circulating the Internet about the Oscar-winning director is to be believed.

According to the Daily Mail, a 23-year-old woman named Beejoli Shah emailed a few friends about a rather odd encounter she had with the 48-year-old Kill Bill director that ended with him masturbating as he sucked on her toes!


Supposedly, Beejoli, a University of California Berkeley graduate who nows work in TV production, met Quentin at a party in LA. After some flirty banter (she brazenly told him that she didn't like his Kill Bill movies) and a while spent making out, Quentin (along with Jamie Foxx who was also allegedly there,) invited her back to his house.

The couple took some photos together (note to celebrities: if you're going to have a kinky one-night stand, you probably want avoid leaving tangible proof of it lying around!), and then the clothes evidently came off. And although Beejoli was not impressed with Quentin's package (she mentioned that his penis was "short" and "nub-like,") that didn't stop her from continuing the sexcapade.

"And thus began the weirdest ten minutes of my life â€” having my feet made out with by an Oscar-winning filmmaker while he pleasured himself," she wrote. Your Man Has A Thing For Your Feet? How To Spice It Up In Bed

In the morning, "He fooled around with my feet one more time (this time without asking, which I found rude), and then drove me back," she added, noting that it was the "most insane experience" of her life.

This isn't the first time we've heard tales about Quentin's love of feet. (He did drink champagne out of Uma Thurman's shoes once, after all!) But, it certainly is the freakiest.

What do you think, CelebLovers? Would you have gone home with Quentin Tarantino and let him romance your feet?
