# Stilavia TDD

This repository is intended to test the implementation of some classes.

Among all development consider these statements:

* Favor immutability over mutability

* Favor linearity over recursion

* Favor encapsulation over exposure

* Explicit is better than implicit (from "The Zen of Python")

* Readability counts (from "The Zen of Python")

* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea (from "The Zen of Python")

## PowerSeries

This class tests the capability to implement a well defined algorithm.

## WordCounter

This class tests the capability to use basic data structures and manage text input stream.

## PackageTree

This class tests the capability to manipulate a tree data structure.
